# PropInvest

An app for property investors to track sale and rental transactions in the Singapore market. The objective is to allow investors to make an informed decision on a property before investing by making available to them historical transactions of properties to analyse trends and for landlords, to track the cashflow of a particular project they have invested in.

**Key features**

1. Search through hundreds of properties in Singapore
2. Create a watchlist to track price movement of sale and rental transactions
3. Create an income/expense calculator to monitor cashflow of an investment

The project is build using the PERN stack and utilises REST API.
